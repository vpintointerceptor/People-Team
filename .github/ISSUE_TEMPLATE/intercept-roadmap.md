## Roadmap description
A customer service roadmap is a high-level visual summary of your customer service vision and goals over time. Your roadmap should act as a strategic tool from which you can check if youâ€™re on track and make new objectives from it. It should be easy to read and be very high level so that anyone looking at your roadmap is clear on your vision and goals for the future.
